# Day 06 â€” Reeborg's World Maze

Solved the Maze problem in [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/).  
This project focused on practicing functions, loops, and conditional logic in Python.  

## Note
The code was written and tested inside the Reeborg's World online editor, so no `.py` file is included here.
